# mo-salamey-work-day-schedular

In this assignment I created a website with a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Actions taken:
* Utilized Moments JS, HTML, and JavaScript to create schedular features and functions.
* Utilized Moments JS for the schedular outline/dispay on the website.    
* Utilized functions for the live time to be displayed on the schedular. 
* Utilized event listener to save inputted data on the schedular with local storage. 
* Utilized "if/else" for sytling/colors on the schedular.
